# E-Commerce Website

## Desscription

The prupose of this project is to learn how create a dynamic web application that simulates a e-commerce shopping website. By using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and APIs, this application displays a keen understanding of how to create an application that allows users to browse through a catalog of items, create their listings, and add items to their own shopping cart. Users may earn a free book from a stored library collection by spending a minimum price and search through the catalog of books once the feature is unlocked. The motication for the project is also to emulate a collaborative environment in which contributors learn how to work together on a collective project by using GitHub is practice features such as local and remote pulls/pushes, reviewing peer submitted code, and pull requests. This project solves the issue of learning how to utilize a wide array of coding knowledge to create applications that are responsive and simply styled.
